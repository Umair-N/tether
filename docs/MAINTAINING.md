# Maintainer checklist

Contributors submit fork pull requests. Only the maintainer merges changes and creates release tags.
Users install tagged releases; `main` is not a release.

## Protect main

- [ ] Keep repository write and admin access with the maintainer only. Do not grant contributors or automation merge access.
- [ ] Merge the [CODEOWNERS file](../.github/CODEOWNERS) and [test workflow](../.github/workflows/test.yml) before you configure protection.
- [ ] Let both CI jobs run once so GitHub knows the `server` and `ui` check names.
- [ ] Review existing protection before you apply the command below; it replaces the supplied settings.
- [ ] Apply protection with a GitHub CLI login that has repository Administration write permission.

Run this command later. It requires pull requests, the `server` and `ui` checks, and one CODEOWNERS approval.
It blocks force pushes and branch deletion. It does not apply the rules to admins, so the maintainer can still push to `main` directly.
Linear history is optional; change `required_linear_history` to `true` to require it.

```bash
gh api --method PUT repos/incmak/tether/branches/main/protection \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
  --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["server", "ui"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
    "require_code_owner_reviews": true,
    "required_approving_review_count": 1
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": false,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
JSON
```

GitHub supports branch push restrictions only for organization-owned repositories.
This personal repository uses `restrictions: null`; the access rule above keeps merges with the maintainer.
CODEOWNERS alone does not limit merge access.
The sole code owner cannot approve their own pull request. The maintainer pushes their own changes to `main` directly, or merges their own pull request as an admin.

See the official [branch protection API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/branches/branch-protection)
and [GitHub CLI input format](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api).

## Approve fork workflows

- [ ] Open repository **Settings → Actions → General**.
- [ ] Under **Approval for running fork pull request workflows from contributors**, select **Require approval for first-time contributors**.
- [ ] Save the setting.
- [ ] Inspect each first-time contributor's changes before you approve the workflow run, especially workflow and dependency changes.

The workflow uses `pull_request`, a read-only token, and no secrets. Keep those properties when you change CI.
Workflow approval permits tests to run; it does not approve or merge the pull request.
See the official [Actions settings guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository).

## Review and merge

1. Check that the pull request contains one change and follows [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Check code, tests, fixtures, and screenshots for secrets and personal data.
3. Check tests for behavior changes, screenshots for UI changes, and docs for changed behavior or setup.
4. Keep the Python server standard-library only, with optional extras isolated.
5. Review the diff and approve as the code owner only when the change is ready.
6. Wait for both `server` and `ui` checks to pass on the current branch state.
7. Resolve review comments and merge as the maintainer. Use squash or rebase merge if linear history is enabled.

## Cutting a release

Only the maintainer creates release tags. A push to `main` does not release software to users.

Run `python3 scripts/release.py X.Y.Z` from any checkout.

- The script makes a clean worktree and bumps the version. It preserves your checkout and its uncommitted work.
- It runs all tests locally, including real tmux and Chromium tests, plus the UI checks and build.
- It commits the version changes, creates an annotated tag, and pushes `main` before the tag.
- It waits for the release if `gh` is available. Use `--no-push` to keep the release local, or `--keep` to keep the worktree.

The tag must equal `v` plus the contents of `VERSION`.
CI only builds the UI, packages, and publishes. Tests run locally before the tag.
It creates `tether-<version>.tar.gz` with the tracked tree and `ui/dist`, plus `SHA256SUMS`.
The archive excludes git metadata, dependencies, and untracked test data.
Only the publication job has `contents: write` permission.
It uses `gh release create` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, tag verification, and generated release notes.
Tags with `-rc` produce prereleases. Daily stable checks use the latest stable release endpoint.

The first-install bootstrap lives in `integrations/claude/tether/skills/setup/bootstrap.py`.
The CLI imports its archive verification, extraction, staging, and atomic switch helpers.
The Codex skill ships an identical copy because a copied skill cannot reach the Claude plugin directory.
`test_integrations` checks that both copies match. Change them together.
`install.py` uses schema version 1 for saved choices; this is independent of the release version.
Keep that schema compatible so migration and updates retain saved choices.
Run `python3 -m unittest -q test_install test_updates test_release_install test_integrations` from `server/` for local release proofs.
These tests use temporary homes, local archives, loopback HTTP, and fake service commands.
